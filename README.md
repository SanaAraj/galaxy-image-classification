# galaxy-image-classification
This project uses Deep Learning architectures for classifying galaxy images. It leverages models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), TensorFlow Hub pretrained models, and techniques such as Batch Normalization, Dropout, and MaxPooling to improve performance and prevent overfitting.
